# Productivity-Meter React+Vite Chrome Extension

This react extension helps user track time spent on each tab daily,weekly,and yearly.
The user needs to add each website it wants to track by clicking on the add button and providing the necessary permissions to the extension.

The extension will keep on tracking as long as the user is on the tab it wishes to track.
If the user switches to another tab the extension will stop the logging.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
